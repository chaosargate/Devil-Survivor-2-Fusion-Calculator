# Devil-Survivor-2-Fusion-Calculator
A really basic fusion calculator for Devil Survivor 2.

This is just a simple project I decided to do to try and learn Ruby. It's more of a proof of concept rather than a full blown development thing.

As of 5/29/2017, this calculator runs off commands written to test.rb and displays the results of combining two demons together. It also catches the 12 special fusions in the game.

Things to add:
* Break down a result into components
* Skills
* Stats
* An actual interface
* Make it game-agnostic since the underlying algorithms should be compatible with most, if not all SMT games.
